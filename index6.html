              <p>This project was inspired by how many people we know who have moved to DC to start a new career. We wanted to provide a platform to give the user the necessary information that they will need to make key life decisions about moving and living and Washington DC.</p>

              <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Data Sources</h2>
              <p>For this project we leveraged DC residential housing information from Kaggle and DC crime data from the metropolitan police department. To supplement our data set and compare DC Housing to other States we used developmental Housing Price Indices sets from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to compare DC Housing versus other States.

              <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase">General Methodology</h2>
              <p>This project builded upon our data cleaning from Project 1 and the ETL project. The housing dataset was mostly clean from prior work, but we had to size down the data to a more managable size in order to make some of the graphics. A variety of technologies were used to accomplish this such as Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, SQL/SQLite, etc. To display the data in a variety of visualizations we utilized Javscript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet via geoJSON, D3 and Plotly. We utilized a javascipt library of leaflet called Folium which allowed us to utilize Python code to generate a leaflet map.</p>
